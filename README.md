# Personal Calculator Project

## Overview
This repository contains a personal calculator project created as a way to practice and expand programming skills. The project is designed to provide a customizable and expandable mathematical tool, with both basic and advanced functionality. Future plans include enhancements such as a graphical user interface (GUI) and AI-powered features.

## Current Version: 0.3.1

### Changelog
#### Version 0.2
- Added input validation to ensure proper operators and operands are used.
- Enhanced code readability by including detailed comments.

#### Version 0.3
- Introduced additional operators, including modulus (`%`) and exponentiation (`^`).
- Implemented a looping mechanism that keeps the program running until the user exits by typing `q`.
- Added JSON files for local program configuration (may require updates).

#### Version 0.3.1
- Hotfix for major bug that caused the program to not exit properly.

### Planned Features and Improvements
- [x] Implement a looping mechanism to eliminate the need to restart the program manually.
- [ ] Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved usability.
- [ ] Add more complex mathematical operations.
- [ ] Explore AI integration for enhanced functionality (long-term goal).
